# Text Encryptor

This is a simple yet powerful project that allows for the encryption and decryption of text by replacing vowels with specific character strings. Ideal for messages you want to keep a bit more private or just for fun with basic cryptography.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Converts the vowels in your text to specific character sequences (`e` -> `enter`, `i` -> `imes`, etc.).
- **Text Decryption**: Reverses the process, converting the character sequences back to their original vowels.
- **Simple Interface**: This project offers an intuitive user interface for encrypting and decrypting text.
- **Clipboard Copying**: Allows for the encrypted/decrypted text to be directly copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Technologies Used

This project has been developed using standard web technologies:

- HTML
- CSS (with a focus on Grid and Flexbox for responsiveness)
- JavaScript

## Usage

No installation is required for this project. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start encrypting or decrypting text.

### Encrypting

1. Enter the text you wish to encrypt in the provided area.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to see the result.
3. Optional: Use the "Copy" button to copy the encrypted text to the clipboard.

### Decrypting

1. Enter the encrypted text in the provided area.
2. Click the "Decrypt" button to see the original text.
3. Optional: Use the "Copy" button to copy the decrypted text to the clipboard.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I faced challenges related to implementing responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Although I have basic knowledge of these design models, adjusting the elements to behave as I wanted across different screen sizes was a significant challenge.
